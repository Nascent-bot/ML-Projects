I don't mind a few things here and there, but when you don't make the bed, when you throw laundry on top of it, when i can't have a friend in the house because i'm embarassed that there's underwear and bras strewn on the bed, pillows on the floor, that's something else.

Thus we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing the following: \n",
